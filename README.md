# JavaScript Mini Projects

Welcome to my collection of fun and beginner-friendly JavaScript projects!  
These projects helped me strengthen my core JavaScript concepts and improve my coding skills through hands-on practice.

Throughout these mini projects, I covered key JavaScript concepts such as:
- Variables and Data Types
- Functions (Arrow Functions, Callback Functions)
- DOM Manipulation
- Event Handling
- Arrays and Objects
- Loops and Conditional Statements
- Local Storage
- Fetch API and JSON
- Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, async/await)
